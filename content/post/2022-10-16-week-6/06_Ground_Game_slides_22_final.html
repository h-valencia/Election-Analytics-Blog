<h2>Blog tip 3</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>: predict PV as literal 2022 poll value, but report the out-of-sample error of raw polls</li>
<li>: use other data (e.g. local economy) for district, but report the out-of-sample error of model</li>
<li>: rather than running district by district regression, use district-level poll model that’s fit all districts (more on this today!)</li>
<li>: use previous election results, generic ballot polls, polls from districts with similar characteristics, as we’ve done in past weeks</li>

<div id="turnout" class="section level2">
<h2>Turnout</h2>
<p>Our weeks on campaigns are trying to understand how voters respond to ads and on-the-ground campaigning efforts. From our readings, we know that campaigns try to do two things:
* (1) mobilize - turning people out to vote
* (2) persuade - convincing people out to vote for a particular candidate/party</p>
<p>First, let’s look at turnout at the district-level to identify any interesting patterns across time and geography.
Then, let’s turn back to last week’s ad data to see whether there is a relationship between turnout and ad spends.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-we-calculate-turnout" class="section level2">
<h2>How do we calculate turnout?</h2>
<p>*<span class="math inline">\(turnout_{district_i} = \frac{totalvotes}{CVAP}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(totalvotes\)</span> is the number of two-party votes cast in a given district in a given year and CVAP is the citizen voting-age population in a given district in a given year. Note the differences between CVAP, voting-age population (VAP), voting eligible population (VEP)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CVAP = total population that is age 18+ and a citizen</p></li>
<li><p>VAP = total population that is age 18+</p></li>
<li><p>VEP = all U.S. citizens age 18+, who are not excluded from voter eligibility due to criminal status (felony convictions, incarceration, or parole)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>*The data we’re working with comes from the American Community Survey’s 5-Year Estimates. The 5-year estimates are “period” estimates that represent data collected over a period of time. The primary advantage of using multiyear estimates is the increased statistical reliability of the data for less populated areas and small population subgroups.</p>
<p>*This means that when a CVAP estimate exists for 2018, we can use that estimate for all years between 2012-2018.</p>

<h2>Blog Extensions</h2>
<p><strong>Turnout model</strong>: Incorporate turnout, incumbency and expert predictions into your district-level two-party voteshare predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Close Elections</strong>: (i) Do expert predictions predict turnout? Fit a model and discuss your results, thinking specifically about whether your results provide evidence for the effect of ground campaigns on turnout.
(ii) Do ad spends predict turnout? Merge last week’s WMP data with this week’s data on turnout at the district level. What can we infer, if anything, about the relationship between the “air war” and voter persuasion/mobilization?</p>
<p><strong>Probabilistic Simulation of District-Level Races.</strong> Update your working forecasting model from one that is based on linear regression to one that is modeled as a GLM.</p>
<p>Extend the binomial regression-based
simulation we did of the Pennsylvania 2022 race to all 2022 races based on the most recent
poll numbers for the Democratic and Republican candidate (in districts for which district-level polling data is available). Make a map of the
of your predictions. Do they make sense? Speculate as to why or why not.</p>
