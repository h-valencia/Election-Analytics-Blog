# How does Klarner and Buchanan's model work in practice?
\tiny
Two approaches outlined:

(1) District-level approach: Polls

(2) Aggregate approach: "National partisan tide" (similar to a fundamentals-only model)
    -health of the economy, presidential approval, quality of candidates, voting intentions
    
Their approach: combine both (similar to what we did last week!)
  -DV: Democrat two-party voteshare
  -IVs: (a) district partisan composition
          (i) past House vote: Democrat two-party voteshare from most recent House election
          (ii) past presidential vote: district presidential voteshare - national Democratic two-party voteshare 
  
  (b) candidate attributes
    (i) Incumbency
    (ii) quality candidate, closed: candidate facing an incumbent
    (iii) quality candidate, open: two non-incumbents
    (iv) past House member, closed
    (v) past House member, open
  
  (c) national partisan tides
    (i) Democratic vote intention: % of respondents who expressed intention to vote for Democratic House candidate (Gallup poll ~March 10)
    (ii) Presidential approval: coded towards Democrats and conditional on party of sitting president (if Dem president, approval rate; if Rep president, disapproval rate) (Gallup poll ~March 10)
    (iii) change in RDI: percent change per capita RDI, February of year before election year - February of election year
    (iv) Midterm penalty: president's party should lose votes

# Individual seat prediction: A district with bad polling data
## Example: Florida District 18 (something with similar demographics or likely R)
  We will "borrow" data from a district that is comparable on relevant variables to OH01. 
  Q: What do you consider relevant variables? What is a reasonable margin for comparison?
  
  General process:
      (1) Choose a district that is comparable on relevant demographic and electoral characteristics
      (2) Append polls
      (3) Consider weighting here: we probably want to attach smaller weights to the borrowed polls
      or account in some other way for the fact that they are borrowed.
      (4) Model
      (5) Predict

See Yao's code in the Class dropbox for starter code on how to do aggregate our seat-level predictions.

## So, what's the deal with incumbency?

\textbf{Some incumbency advantages}: \pause

  * More media coverage
  * Campaign finance access \pause
  * \textbf{\textcolor{pink}In the presidential context, {"Pork"}} $\rightsquigarrow$ short-term economic gains (Bartels 2008), 
  credit-claiming (Kriner and Reeves 2012)

\textbf{Some incumbency (dis/non-)advantages}: \pause

  * Polarized electorate $\rightsquigarrow$ partisanship, not incumbency matters (Donovan et al. 2019)
  * Recessions, disasters $\rightsquigarrow$ blame attribution (Achen and Bartels 2016)
  * Incumbency fatigue

## (2) Credit and blame: the time-for-change model
\pause 
Alan Abramowitz's \textbf{time-for-change} model is a classic model of incumbency
and, since 1992, has a \underline{true} out-of-sample PV prediction error of $1.7\%$ 
\textcolor{red}{(Typically used in the presidential forecasting context, but if we consider the fact 
that midterm elections are often referenda on the president, it may be relevant).}

$$
\underbrace{\texttt{pv2p}}_{incumbent \ party} = A + B_1 \underbrace{\texttt{G2GDP}}_{Q2 \ \ GDP \ growth} + B_2 \underbrace{\texttt{NETAPP}}_{Gallup \ job \ approval} + B_3 \underbrace{\texttt{TERM1INC}}_{sitting \ pres}

# Preview of next week: Probabilistic models

## One major problem with linear regression

* When we fit a linear regression model $Y = \alpha + \beta X$, there are no restrictions on $Y$. What's wrong with that? \pause

* $\rightsquigarrow$ It is possible to have a prediction interval lower bound $< 0$ (\textbf{out of support}). \pause

* \textbf{This often occurs when we are extrapolating but also when there is sparse data} \pause \textbf{(e.g. district-level polls).}

## Solution: probabilistic models

* In a linear regression, $$DemPV_{state} = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \ldots + \beta_k x_k,$$ our probabilistic assumption is that errors in predicted PV follow a bell curve, $DemPV_{state} - \widehat{DemPV_{state}} \sim Normal()$ \pause

* In reality, the process of elections is some "draw" of voters from the voter-eligible population (VEP) turning out to vote for a party: \small
$$
\Pr\Big(DemPV_{district} = \texttt{2  million} \ | \ VEP_{district} = \texttt{5  million}\Big) = 
f(\alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \ldots + \beta_k x_k)
$$ 
with some other probabilistic assumption, $DemPV_{district} \sim ?$. \pause

* A model that allows the DV or error to have a non-normal distribution (specified by a particular choice of function $f(\cdot)$) is called a \textbf{generalized linear model} $\rightsquigarrow$ \textcolor{red}{more on this and how to apply them in \textsf{R} next time!}

1. \textbf{How accurate are expert predictions? pt.1} Visualize actual voteshare (seatshare) in 2018 and compare that to various expert predictions for that election cycle. How do they compare? 

2. \textbf{How accurate are expert predictions? pt.2} Visualize actual voteshare (seatshare) in 2018 and compare that to various expert predictions for that election cycle. How do they compare? Create 3 maps: (1) a map that visualizes voteshare (seatshare) at the district-level; (2) a map that visualizes expert predictions at the district-level; (3) a map that visualizes the difference between actual voteshare and expert prediction at the district-level.

This is going to require you to use your own discretion in coding up variables.

On (2): these expert predictions are in the form of "lean D/R," "likely D/R," etc. Transform these variables into a continuous numeric variable, i.e. "Likely R" ~ -2, "Lean R" ~ -1, "Tossup" ~ 0, "Lean D" ~ 1, "Likely D" ~ 2, and so on. Visualize the results.

On (3): you will need to figure out how to compare voteshare and expert predictions. One possibility: transform one of the variables to be on the same scale as the other variable. Ex: voteshare of 54% for Democrats ~ "Safe D," voteshare of 52% for Democrats ~ "Likely D," etc. or vice versa, "Safe D" district ~ "54% voteshare" ...
