summary: "This week we learned about how election turnout can affect the outcome of races, and how on-the-ground campaigning efforts aim to mobilize and persuade voters. We can look at this data on the district-level to uncover patterns, and compare it to last week's data on ad spending to see how they interact."

<p>where I left off:
- figuring out how to incorporate generic ballot
- generic ballot is national level data, BUT we have many observations for each year because so many pollsters measuring
- looking at <code>poll</code> df, can either average across years OR pick top grade pollsters then average ? any other options?
- from here, for extension #1 just need to add district turnout to complete
- should also go back to using the <code>data</code> df for now, don’t need the <code>solid_dist_data</code> / <code>battle_dist_data</code> quite yet
- add CVAP data to <code>data</code>
- is there a way to incorporate <code>house_polls_long</code>? This is the df with DEM / REP - is this a different kind of polling? does this have to do with this week’s discussion of the ground game? a little confused on the difference between this df and the other dfs…
- still need to figure out how to combine everything into a model that gives RESULTS and can PREDICT vote pctg or seat share… make a MAP with each
- is predicting each district the equivalent of predicting seat share?</p>
