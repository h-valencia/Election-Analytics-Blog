<p><em>This blog is part of a series related to Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> taught by Professor <a href="http://ryandenos.com/">Ryan D. Enos</a></em>.</p>
<p><em>Over the past nine weeks, we have explored a multitude of variables that may impact election outcomes in an attempt to forecast the 2022 midterm election. We have learned about economic forces, polling, expert predictions, incumbency, advertising, campaigning, and more to find if they hold any predictive power, and how together in a model they may foreshadow what is to come in the results next week. In this blog, I will create a final prediction model for the House of Representatives and share its results, with the intention of reflecting on it after the election.</em></p>
<p>Since this class first convened in the beginning of September, we have time and time again been reminded of the shortcomings of election forecasting. Elections are fickle and there is no way to know for certain how voters will vote on election day. The experts oftentimes cannot predict what will happen, if an election will be toss-up or a landslide. There are shocks that no one sees coming, costs of voting that may be unanticipated, various biases with polling, and ever-changing political opinions that result from all sorts of issues and news. While these unknowns make forecasting very difficult, we have gained the tools over the last nine weeks that give us a good foundation to create predictions of our own for the House of Representatives midterm election.</p>
<p>In the first week of class, we looked at how Real Disposable Income (RDI) on its own does a decent job of predicting elections.</p>
